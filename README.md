Experiments with Rust and Blender/Python.

While C and C++ are the defacto programming languages for native binaries, Rust is much easier to set up and include with minimal packaging setup. This repo is an experiment and will evolve as I learn more about Rust/Python FFI. Pull requests and bug reports are welcome.
